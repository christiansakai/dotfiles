# Skin in The Game
## Book 1 - Introduction
### Prologue, Part 1 - Antaeus Whacked

* You can't separate anything from contact/having exposure with real world, and paying for its consequencees, good or bad
* The knowledge we get by tinkering, via trial and error, and the workings of time, is vastly superior to that obtained through reasoning, something self-serving institutions have been busy hiding from us
* First, do no harm, and even more, those who don't take risks should never be involved in making decisions
* Monarchs derive their legitimacy from a social contract that requires physical risk-taking. The status of a lordship traditionally has been derived from protecting others, trading personal risk for prominence. You can't e a lord if you aren't lord
* Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her action. Centralization gives birth to more bureaucracy
* We need to decentralize, to localize, to have fewer of these immune decision makers
  * Decentralization is based on the simple notion that it is easier to macrobullshit than microbullshit
  * Decentralization reduces large structural asymmetries
  * System who do not decentralize and distribute, will eventually happen by itself the hard way, caused by buildup of imbalance
* Government interference in general tends to remove skin in the game
* Those who are not exposed to risk doesn't learn
* You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can
* The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding or doing
  * The more people worship the state or large corporations, the more they hate skin in the game
  * The more they believe in their ability to forecast, the more they hate skin in the game
  * The more they wear suits and ties, the more they hate skin in the game
* We know what is wrong with more clarity than what is right, and that knowledge grows by subtraction. Actions that remove are more robust than those that add because addition may have unseen, complicated feedback loops
* Skin in the game keeps human hubris in check

### Prologue, Part 2 - A Brief Tour of Symmetry

* Risks are often hidden in the corners, and only the people familiar with the domain can detect
* Examples of symmetry laws:
  * An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
  * Love your neighbor as yourself
  * Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
  * Act only in accordante with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it will become a universal law
  * Conduct yourself toward your parents as you would have your children conduct themselves toward you
* Instead of the Golden Rule, a better version is via negativa Golden Rule. That is, do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you
* First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States is an example of Golden Rule via negativa
  * You can practice your freedom of religion as long asy ou allow me to practice mine
  * You have the right to contradict me so long as I have the right to contradict you
* Universal behavior is great on paper, but disastrous in practice
  * Micro works better than macro
  * We are too local and practical
  * We need simple practical rules
* Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice
* You do not want to win an argument. You want to win
* We are much better at doing than undertanding
* You may not know in your mind where you are going, but you know it by doing
* People's explanations are just words, tories they tell themselves. What they do, on the other hand, is tangible and measurable and that's what we should focus on
* Real life is too complicated to be reduced in words. Exposures are highly nonlinear
* If something stupid works, it cannot be stupid 
* What is rational is what allows the collective - entities meant to live for a long time - to survive
* Skin in the game is an overall necessity, but let us not get carried away in applying it to everything in sight in its every detail, particularly when consequences are contained
  * No harm in voicing an opinion in a conversation
  * But focus instead on those who are professionally slanted, causing harm without being accountable for it, by the very structure of their own occupation
* Profesionall asymmetric person, though causes a lot of problems, is rare. Most people we encounter in real life pay a price for their mistakes
* Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk
* Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication (before their final collapse)
* Skin in the game makes learning thrilling and pleasuring
  * Risks, dangers force people to take actions that they never thought were possible
* Two ways to make citizens safe from large predators (i.e., big powerful corporations)
  * Enact regulations, but good lawyers can game regulations
    * Regulations are additive and ended up becoming more and more complicated
    * Corporation can use regulations to protect themselves and stifle newcomers
    * Some systemic effects may require regulation. If you can't effectively sue, regulate
  * Put skin in the game in transactions, in the form of legal liabilities
* People who are not morally independent tend to fit ethics to their profession (with a minimum of spinning) rather than find a profession that fits their ethics
* Anything you do to optimize your work, cut some corners, or squeeze more "efficiency" out of it (and out of your life) will eventually make you dislike it
* The mere presence of an assistant suspends your natural filtering, and its absence forces you to do only things you enjoy, and progressively steer your life that way
  * With exceptions of assistants hired for specific tasks
  * You want maximal free time, not maximal activity
  * Having an assistant (except for the strictly necessary) removes your soul from the game
* The skills at making things diverge from those at selling things
* It may be cruel to cheat people of their profession. People want to have their soul in the game
  * Decentralization and fragmentation, aside from stabilizing the system, improve people's connection to their labor

### Prologue, Part 3 - The Ribs of the Incerto

* Whenever there is a mismatch between a bonus period (yearly) and the statistical occurrence of a blowup (every say, ten years) the agent has an incentive to play the Bob Rubin risk-transfer game. Given the number of people trying to get on the money-making bus, there is a progressive accumulation of Black Swan risks in such systems. Then, boom, the systemic blowup happens
* If you can't put your soul into something, give it up and leave that stuff to someone else
* Learning is rooted in repetition and convexity, the reading of a single text twice is more profitable than reading two different things once, provided of course that said text has some depth of content
* Asymmetries in Society
  * No Skin In the Game
    * Keeps upside, transfers downside to others, owns a hidden option at someone else's expense
    * Bureaucrats, policy wonks
    * Consultants, sophists
    * Large corporations with access to the state
    * Corporate executives (with suit)
    * Scientsts who play the system, theoreticians, data miners, observational studies
    * Centralized government
    * Copy editors
    * Journalists who "analyze" and predict
    * Politicians
    * Bankers
    * Seeks awards, prizes, honors, ceremonies, medals, tea with the Queen of England, membership in academies, handshake with Obama
  * Skin In the Game
    * Keeps his own donside, takes his or her own risk
    * Citizens
    * Merchant, businessmen
    * Artisans
    * Enterpreneurs
    * Laboratory and field experimenters
    * Government of city-states
    * Writers, (some) editors
    * Speculators
    * Activists
    * Hedge fund traders
  * Skin In the Game of Others, or Soul In the Game
    * Takes the downside on behalf of others, or for universal values
    * Saints, knights, warriors, soldiers
    * Prophets, philosophers (in the pre-modern sense)
    * Artists, some artisans
    * Entrepreneurs/Innovators
    * Maverick scientists who take risks with conjecture at distance from common beliefs
    * Municipal government
    * Real writers
    * Journalists who take risks and expose frauds (powerful regimes, corporations), rebels
    * Dissidents, revolutionaries
    * Would not engage in vulgar commerce
    * Highest - even only - award is death for one's ideas or positions: Socrates, Jesus, Saint Catherine, Hypatia, Joan of Arc

## Book 2 - A First Look at Agency
### Chapter 1 - Why Each One Should Eat His Own Turtles: Equality in Uncertainty

* You need to eat what you feed to others
* Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is "good for you" while it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn't directly affect him
  * Such advice is usually unsolicited
* Salesman often buys client expensive gifts so that the clients feel "obligated" to buy something from the salesman
* One lauds merrily the merchandise to get rid of it
* "Giving advice" as a sales pitch is fundamentally a conflict of interest, the two need to be kept separate
* Is it ethical to sell something knowing the price will eventually drop?
  * Traders have straightforward answers
    * It is not okay to sell that to other professional traders
    * It is okay to do that to the anonymous market and faceless nontraders (called "the Swiss", some random sucker away)
  * According to Diogenes of Babylon and Antipater of Tarsus
    * Diogenes held that the seller ought to disclose as much as civil war requires
    * Antipater believed that everything ought to be disclosed - beyond the wall - so that nothing that the seller knew that the buyer didn't know
    * Antipater position is more robust, because the ethical is always more robust than the legal. Overtime, it is the legal that should converge to the ethical, never the reverse
    * Laws come and go; ethics stay
* Sharia law's idea is such that no person in a transaction should have certainty about the outcome while the other one has uncertainty
  * However Sharia law doesn't address the problem of weak asymmetry
  * Say someone has inside information which gives and edge in the markets, but Sharia law doesn't make this illegal because there remains enough uncertainty for both parties, given that the price is in the future and only God knows the future
* Jewish ethics on the other hand aims on transparency concerning what the seller has in mind, what he thinks deep down
  * It may not be ethically required, but the most effective, shame-free policy is maximal transparency, even transparency of intentions
  * But does this theory affect those outsiders whom our ethical rules don't apply to? It seems that there would be a case where our ethical rules would be relaxed or possibly lifted. Theory is too theoretical for humans. The more confined our ethics, the less abstract, the better it works
* When Athenians treat all opinions equally and discuss "democracy", they only apply it to their citizen, not slaves or metics (H-1B or green card equivalent)
  * Roman citizens who married "barbarians" also deprived from democrazy rights
  * Jewish ethics distinguishes between thick blood and thin blood: we are all brothers, but some are more brothers than others
* In modern world, there still exists in-clubs and out-clubs distinction between people
* There is a limit on which rules cease to apply. It is unfortunate, but the general kills the particular. Is it possible to be both ethical and universalist? In theory yes, but sadly not in practice. For whenever the "we" becomes too large of a club, things degrade, and each one starts fighting for his own interest. The abstract is way too abstract for us
* This is why the author advocate political systems that start with the municipality, and work their way up. Being tribal is not a bad thing, and we have to work in a fractal way in the ogranized harmonious relations between tribes, rather than merge all tribes in one large soup.
* The scale transformation from the particular to the general is behind the author's skepticism about unfettered globalization and large centralized multiethnic states 
  * Better fences make better neighbors
  * Near East policies failed. Putting Shiites, Christians and Sunnis in one pot and asking them to be together has failed
  * Neighbors get along better than roommates
* Modernity emphasizes the individual and the universal collective
  * The skin in the game just you, a unit
  * In reality, skin in the game is a broader set of people
  * Individuals in city vs groups in small villages
* Tragedy of the commons in game theory
  * There exists a certain community size below which people act as collectivists, protecting the commmons, as if the entire unit become rational
  * Such a commons cannot be too large
  * Groups behave differently at a different scale
  * The municipal is different from the national
  * How tribes operate: you are part of a specific group that is larger than the narrow you, but narrower than humanity in general. People share some things but not others within a specified group. There is a protocol for dealing with the outside
* The skin-in-the-game definition of commons: a space in which you are treated by others the way you treat them, where everyone exercise the Silver Rule
* Synkyndineo, means "taking risks together", was requirement in maritime transactions
  * Acts of the Apostles describe a voyage of St. Paul on a cargo ship from Sidon to Crete to Malta. As they hit a storm, they eat, and they lightened the ship by throwing the corn overboard into the sea
    * This is a pratice as old as 800 B.C.
    * Where merchandise is thrown overboard for the purpose of lightening a ship, what has been lost for the benefit of all must be made up by the contribution of all
  * On caravans along desert route, if merchandise was lost or stolen, all merchants hand to split the costs, not just its owner
* Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio
  * One buys a stock because he/she likes it, then commenting on it (and disclosing such ownership) - the most reliable advocate for a product is its user
  * Another is buying a stock so you can advertise the qualities of the company, then selling it, benefiting from the trumpeting - this is called market manipulation, a conflict of interests
* Medicine profession is fundamentally apprenticeship based and grounded in experience, not just experimentation and theories
  * There is skin in the game at many degrees in medicine profession
  * The legal system and regulatory measures are likely to put the skin of the doctor in the wrong game
  * Too much reliance on metrics is bad, because every metric is gameable
  * Too much reliance on metrics make doctors pushed by the system to transfer risk from himself to the patients, from the present into the future, or from the immediate future into a more distant future
  * A doctor has no direct emotional loss in regard the patient degradation, so his objective is naturally to avoid a lawsuit, something that can prove disastrous to his career
* To make medicine less asymmetric is for patient to avoid treatment when he or she is mildly ill, but use medicine for the rarely encountered severe conditions. The mildly ill represent a much larger pool of people than the severely ill and are people who are expected to live longer and consume drugs for longer - hence the pharmaeutical companies have an incentive to focus on them

## Book 3 - The Greatest Asymmetry
### Chapter 2 - The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dominance of the Stubborn Minority

* It suffices for an intransigent minority with significant skin in the game (or better, soul in the game) to reach a minutely small level, say 3 or 4 percent of the total population, for the entire population to have submit to their preferences
  * An optical illusion comes wit hthe dominance of the minority: a naive observer who looks at the standard average would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority
* All it takes is a small number of intolerant, virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly
* Kosher population represents less than 3% of the USA residents, yet it appears that almost all drinks all kosher 
  * A kosher (or halal) eater will never eat nonkosher (or nonhalal) food, but a nonkosher eater isn't banned from eating kosher
* A disabled person will not use the regular bathroom, but a nondisabled person will use the bathroom for disabled people
* Someone with a peanut allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts, but a person without such allergy can eat items with peanut traces in them
* An honest person will never commit criminal acts, but a criminal will readily engage in legal acts
* We call the minority an intransigent group, and the majority the flexible one
* It makes a big difference whether the intransigents are in their own districts or are mixed with the rest of the population
  * If people following the minority rule lived in ghettos with a separate small economy, then the minority rule would not apply
  * But when a population has an even spatial distribution, say, when the ratio of such a minority in a neighborhood is the same as that in the entire village, that in the village is the same as in the county, that in the county is the same as in the state, and that in the state is the same as nationwide, then the flexible majority will have to submit to the minority rule
* Cost structure matters
  * Kosher law doesn't change the price of food by much
  * If it does, then the minority rule will not apply, except perhaps in some very rich neighborhoods
* Consider non transgenic GMO eaters will eat non GMOs, but not the reverse
  * Say you have an event, you don't send everyone questionnaire asking people if they eat or don't eat transgenic GMO
  * You select everything non GMO, provided the price difference is not consequential
  * As organic food is in higher demand, thanks to the minority rule, the distribution costs decrease and the minority rule ends up accelerating in its effect
* The spread of automatic shifting cars is not because the majority preference, it could just be because those who can drive manual shifts can always drive automatic, but the reverse is not true
* Some extreme left or right wing party has support, say 10%. These are the baseline inflexible votes that will always vote for their faction
  * But some of the flexible voters can also vote for that extreme faction
  * Watch out for these swing voters because they may swell the number of votes for the extreme party
* Once you have 10% or more women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine
* Lingua francas can come from minority rule
  * French was supposed to be the language of diplomacy, as civil servants coming from aristocratic background used it, while their more vulgar compatriots involved in commerce relied on English
    * English won as commerce grow to dominate modern life
    * English speakers are less likely to know other languages
  * Aramaic succeded Canaanite language (Phoenician-Hebrew) in the Levant and resembles Arabic
    * Persians who speak an Indo-European language spread Aramaic
    * Persians taught Egyptians a language that was not their own
    * When Persians invaded Babylon they found an administration with scribes who could only use Aramaic and did not know Persian
    * Leads to the oddity of Aramaic being used in Mongolia
  * Arabs using Greek in their early administration in the seventh and eight centuries
    * It was Romans who accelerated the spreading of Greek
* Genes follow majority rule; languages minority rule. Languages travel; genes less so
* Under Islamic law
  * If a non Muslim man marries a Muslim woman, he needs to convert to Islam
  * And if either parent of a child happens to be Muslim, the child will be Muslim
  * Becoming Muslim is irreversible, an apostasy is sanctioned by death penalty
* This is how a small Islamic group occyping Christian (Coptic) Egypt, can lead, over the centuries, to the Copts becoming a tiny minority. All one needs is a small rate of interfaith marriages
  * Many conversion was mostly for administrative procedure, something that helps one land a job or handle a problem that requires Islamic jurisprudence
  * One did not have to really believe in it
  * Little by little a Christian or Jewish family engaging in the conversion, a couple of generations later, the descendants forget the arrangement of their ancestors
* Judaism doesn't spread and tends to stay in the minority
  * As the religion has weaker rules: the mother is required to be Jewish
* Three Gnostic faiths in Near East (Druze, Ezidi, Mandeans) is depleted
  * Because the knowledge typically only accessible to only a minority of elders
  * These three religions require both parents to have the faith, otherwise the family is abandoned
* Islam Sunni is being taken over by purists simply because they are more intolerant than the rest
* How do books get banned
  * Not because they offend the average person - most persons are passive and don't really care
  * It takes only a few motivated activists for the banning of some books
* The formation of moral values in society doesn't come from the evolution of the consensus. It is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance

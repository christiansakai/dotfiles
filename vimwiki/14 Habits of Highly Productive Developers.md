# 14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers

## Part 1: Principles

* Things take time, and intensity is not always the answer.The habits you decide to cultivate (or not cultivate) will determine your future life opportunities

## Part 2: Learning Habits
### Habit 1: Look For The Signals

* The oldest, shortest words - yes and no - are those which rewquire the most thought
* There is no such thing as the best tool
* Practice the JOMO (the joy of missing out), which is mostly about being happy and content with that you already know
* You need to be able to identify what is signal and what is just noise
* Understand that the noise will always be there. You need to learn how to cherry-pick what is relevant to you
* Accept the fact you simply can't learn everything, but you can learn enough to be efective
* Desires are endless, needs are limited
* Say more 'noes' so you can say 'yes' to what really matters to you
* Some practical questions on to invest on what technology
  * What are the absolute must-have technical requirements for whatever I am working on?
  * How easy it is going to be for others to work on with what I am building, and what will it look like for them to integrate it in whatever projects they are working on
  * Is what I'm doing aligned with the trajectory of the open web, standards, and specifications I believe will stick around over the long term?
  * Does it improve my productivity?
  * Does it improve the UX of the type of projects I usually build?
  * What problems is this new technolgy or framework trying to solve?
  * How is it different form existing framework/technologies?
  * Do I need to learn something new to be able to learn it?
  * Can I take advantage of my existing skills and knowledge?
  * What about infrastructure?
  * Any other companies use this in production?
  * Will it help my career?
* At the very least, always learn an overview of the technology, so you know what it's about

### Habit 2: Focus On The Fundamentals

* You can practice shooting eight hours a day, but if your technique is wrong, then all you bcome is very good at shooting the wrong way. Get the fundamentals down and the level of everything you do will rise
* It is important to understand core concepts such as algorithms, logic, network, accessibility, security, and user experience
* If you pick a programming language, try to rewrite something you've already written before in that new language

### Habit 3: Teaching Equals Learning

* Power comes not from knowledge kept but from knowledge shared
* If you reall want to learn something, you have to teach it
* Teach others in public. Start by sharing links on social media, writing blog posts, giving talks, and recording screen casts
* A good measure of how well you are able to teach a topic is, do you understand it well enough to be effective? If a topic is say, a tool - do you know when you shouldn't use it?
* Giving a talk does not mean you are the most expert person in the world about something. It means you want to share a piece of knowledge with others

## Part 3: Daily Habits
### Habit 4: Be Boring

* Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again
* There's a fine line between intensity and burnout
* Finite Game
  * There are fixed rules, known players, and agreed-upon objectives
  * The objective of the game is to win
* Infinite Games
  * Unknown rules and unknown players
  * There are no winners and losers, only quitters
  * Th objective is to keep playing
* Problem starts to happen when there's a finite player competing against an infinite player because the finite player is playing to win and the infinite player is playing to stay in the game
* Programming is an infinite game
* Discipline. Consistenty. Persistency. They are the key to playing infinite games

### Habit 5: Do It For Your Future Self

* When you feel the need to write a comment, first try to refactor the code so that any comment becomes superfluous
* Write for your future self
* Don't try to be clever, don't try to code something to make you feel smarter, you don't need to show off all the new tricks you just learned. Just write readable code. Think about maintainability. Ask yourself this question: "Will the fturue me understand the intention of this code?"
* Try to see the progression of where you believe the technology will be in 3 - 5 years
* Be emphatize to anyone that could touch that code in the future. Make code readable with to anyone with any level of experience
* Early optimization is the root of all evil
* Always test everything you write

### Habit 6: Your 9-to-5 Is Not Enough

* Don't expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen. You won't be. Don't count on motivation. Count on discipline
* Invest extra hours to your craft. Because we are bound to the constraints of the company we work at. Our regular jobs ar enot enough to show our full potential

## Part 4: Career Habits
### Habit 7: Master The Dark Side

* Named must your fear be, before banish it you can
* Know the business (non programming) side, because
  * Saves time. The better you understand the business, the more capable you will be to solve edge-cases and implications yourself instead of having to schedule a meeting with the domain expert to find a solution
  * Prevent complex code. You will know which part of the codebase needs more attention than others
  * Better prioritize 
* Start with the vocabulary. Pay attention to the specific words and terms used by the business folks. This makes communication with them more effective.
* A person who knows how to code is powerful, a person who knows how to code and knows how business works is unstoppable

### Habit 8: Side Projects

* Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment
* Twitter, Craigslist, and Slack all started as side projects
* List of helpful questions to start side projects
  * Do I really enjoy this subject, field, type of work?
  * Am I willing to spend at least 5 years working on this idea?
  * Can I execute this idea fully by myself?
  * Is this particular idea better than others I had in the past? Is there any other idea that could better use my time?
  * Do I personally experience this problem or am I solving it for someone else?
  * Why am I excited about this idea now?

### Habit 10: Mario or Sonic?

* At the beginning of your career, it's ok to switch jobs frequently. However, there's a side effect to this. The less time you spend on a project, the more superficial you'll be as a professional. The more time you spend on a project, the more opportunities you'll have for long-term impact
* Missionaries vs Mercenarios
  * You have to stay somewhere for a certain amount of time to make an impact and expose yourself ot the opportunities that will take your career to the next level.

## Part 5: Team Habits
### Habit 10: Active Listening

* Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something
* A company is made up with variety of people. Decision sometimes made with numbers and sometimes made with gut feelings. Problems are created, and solved with or without you. Even as a founder, there will be many things that you simply won't have control or visibility over
* If you want to become effective, you need to be able to communicate well
* Don't listen to reply, but listen to understand. Anyone can reply, few can understand
* Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always
* The only efficient manner of communicating in remote jobs is by providing as much context as possible
* Pull request or an issue must provide a context
* As a leader, especially when assembling a team from scratch or adding new members, you need to make sure that you are always bridging the context gap in communication

### Habit 11: Don't Underestimate

* We underestimate because
  * We want to impress others
  * We forget that's not all about coding. There are time needed to build, create tests, documentation, merge conflicts, attend daily meetings, etc
  * We don't focus on one thing. It takes time to get into the zone
  * We think everyone is the same. We must understand that estimates are strictly individual
  * We can't handle the pressure
* Admit that it is impossible to be 100% accurate with estimates
* Why estimates at all? Because you will get closer and closer to it everytime you do it
  * Separate large tasks into smaller ones that require no more than 2 days of effort
  * Estimate in ranges, worst case, most likely case, best case
  * For first time development with new technology, allow for a 20% to 40% increase in effort
  * Document and communicate the assumptions embedded in your estimate
  * Do bottom up estimation (by people who will actually do the work)
* Under-promise and over-deliver. Over-estimate and deliver before the deadline

### Habit 12: Specialist vs Generalist

* Specialist - Pros
  * Good compensation in that specific field
  * Gain a lot of technical authority in a particular subject
  * Need to keep up to date only in one platform/language
  * Companies are always searching for specialist people in that specific field
* Specialist - Cons
  * Hard to find position if your specialization is too narrow
  * If the chosen technology is obsolete, it will be hard to start from the bottom again
  * Knowledge might be too company-dependent, skills are not transferable
  * If there is an urgent to choose another technology, chances are you will take longer to complete a certain task
* Specialist - Work Opportunities
  * Senior positions, especially at big companies
  * Research projects at universities
  * Freelancer in a specific field
* Generalist - Pros
  * Used to learning new technologies fast
  * Wide variety of opportunities that you can pursue in different industries
  * Flexible and easy to transition to a new job
  * If you need to switch context to a different task, there's a chance you will find a solution faster than others
* Generalist - Cons
  * Hard to stay updated in a lot of different languages and technologies
  * Take a long time to solve very complex and technology-specific problems
  * Difficult to reach a leadership position if you are changing fields constantly
  * Even though it is easier to find a new position, it may be arduous to show that you are the best candidate
* Generalist - Work Opportunities
  * Startups/Early stage companies
  * Consultancy opportunities
  * Start your own business
* Leaders tend to be generalist
* These are not permanent states
* Ask this question instead: "How can I better help my team?"
* Learn how to learn in a way that allows you to mentally touch bottom on a new subject as fast as you can and become functionally capable in the target areas as quickly as possible
* Find what interests and motivates you

## Part 6: Life Habits
### Habit 13: Control Your Variables

* The only thing you sometimes have control over is perspective. You don't have control over your situation. But you have a choice about how you view it
* Newton fled to his family farm during an epidemic, and formulated a theory of gravity, a new theory of light, and calculus
* Variables you can control
  * Your thoughts
  * Who your friends are
  * What you eat and drink
  * How you spend your money
  * What you do with your time
  * How you treat your body
  * How much you appreciate the things you already have
* Stop wasting time on variables that are out of your control. Focus on the variables that you can change
* Stay positive and avoid social media
* Things that we can't control will draw our energy and time, and our energy and time are limited

### Habit 14: Stop Waiting

* We suffer more in imagination than in reality
* The only thing that prevents you from achieving something is yourself
* Behind each excuse there is an alternative. Behind each goal there is a series of tasks that could be done today
